    <subject>In-Flight Video Streaming that Won’t Leave You Screaming</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

In-flight video streaming at 30,000 feet is a beautiful thing. 


Especially when passengers use it to login to the big shareholder conference, live-chat with an important customer, or watch their favorite team live on opening day.

But streaming video is a glutton for data and too often operators experience sticker shock when they open their data service bill. 

GoDirect Data Control lets you tighten the pipeline and control the amount of data live-streaming consumes – without impacting the customer experience.
