    <subject>What’s the Word on The Street? Better Inflight Wi-Fi! ✈️</subject>

What Do Passengers Really Think About Inflight Wi-Fi?
&lt;[[https://youtu.be/qvFnC4mSI6w]]&gt;
Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},
Honeywell took to the streets of New York City to find out what passengers really think about inflight Wi-Fi. And the word &lt;[[https://youtu.be/qvFnC4mSI6w]]&gt; is clear – current connectivity options are disappointing, unreliable and spotty. 

Airline passenger desires are simple - check email, listen to music and watch videos wherever they fly. We want the freedom to stay connected! Honeywell’s JetWave™ system, which exclusively powers Inmarsat’s Ka-band GX Aviation service, can do just that. So why not give your customers what they want.






READY TO GET CONNECTED? &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/pages/Honeywell-JetWave-Provides-High-Speed-Connectivity-Globally]]&gt;</textOnly>
