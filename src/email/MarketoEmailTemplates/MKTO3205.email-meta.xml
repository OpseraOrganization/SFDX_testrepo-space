Dear {{lead.First Name:default=customer}},

Are you ready to test the new flight planning experience from Honeywell GoDirect? Click HERE &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/GoDirectFlight_Beta.html]]&gt; to start now! 

We’ve completely overhauled your flight planning experience with a next-generation website and refreshed electronic flight bag app GoDirect Flight Bag Pro. 

In the coming weeks here are some of the benefits you will see:



	- The use of flight management system (FMS) algorithm’s in conjunction with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) performance data for more accurate flight planning performance calculations. 

	- 4D flight planning optimization which considers time when creating a route.

	- More Eurocontrol flight plans cleared as filed using our new B2B connection.

	- Improved efficiency with route overlays, mapping and tracking to plan routes that match your goals. 

	- Saved time with faster speeds when computing a flight plan.
