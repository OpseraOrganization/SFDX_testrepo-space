Dear {{lead.First Name:default=customer}},

Your avionics are a big investment – an investment worth protecting. Our records indicate that the factory warranty on {{lead.Aircraft Tail Number:default=your aircraft}} expires in 2019. The Honeywell Maintenance Service Plan is the perfect solution for fixed-wing operators who want to keep their aircraft flying and control their annual maintenance budget with the industry’s premier fixed-price protection plan.

With Honeywell&apos;s Maintenance Service Plan, you can choose the coverage that best meets your needs, and take advantage of flexible contract options, discounts for early enrollment on many aircraft and special pricing for fleet operators.

We know you&apos;ve made a significant investment in your aircraft! An investment that deserves to be protected. Contact Spirit Aeronautics today to learn more or to request a quote.
