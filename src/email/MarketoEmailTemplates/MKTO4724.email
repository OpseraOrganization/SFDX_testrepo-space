Hello!
<br /> 
<br />My name is Jenni and I’m the product line director for Honeywell’s sensor portfolio. I am humbled and excited that you are considering our sensors for your next project. 
<br />
<br /> To help us best serve you, please take a minute to tell us a little more about your inquiry: 
<br /> 
<ol> 
<li>What is your role?</li> 
<li>What is the application?</li> 
<li>Is this a new application or a replacement in an existing application?</li> 
<li>Is your question technical (product selection / data sheet) or transactional (quote / lead time)?</li> 
</ol> Thanks for your time. 
<br />
<br /> Jenni Strabley
