    <subject>Take Back Control of Planning</subject>

Hi, {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}}
Before working with Honeywell Aerospace, the Chief Pilots we partner with had little control over how they planned their routes. Worse still, without an intelligent route forecasting the cleared-as-filed rates with air traffic control were low and time-consuming.
Thanks to Honeywell’s GoDirect Flight Planning &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/services/aerospace-services/flight-planning?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=19_godirectflight_bga&amp;utm_term=email4]]&gt; software, they took back control of planning, comparing multiple routes and cruise models – at the same time!
I would love to tell you more and discuss how Honeywell Aerospace can help {{lead.Company Name:default=your company}} achieve similar results. Are you free for a brief call this week?
