    <textOnly>Honeywell Aerospace Wants Your Feedback!
Last year we launched an annual supplier survey which allowed us to gain your perspective on how we can improve our working relationship with you. We took those responses and put them into action by focusing on the following key areas: 



	- Business processes
	- Communications
	- Design Manufacturability
	- NPI/ESE
	- Continuous Improvement


We recognize we still have work to do to improve in some of these areas. We would like to welcome your feedback once again to learn where we have improved since the last survey and where we need to continue to focus. This short survey is anonymous, should you choose not to provide your contact information, and should only take between 6-8 minutes to complete.
Take the Survey &lt;[[https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/93BZXGT]]&gt;
Our team highly values all feedback, both positive and negative, as well as new ideas for improvement. All responses are reviewed in detail with action plans put in place to help improve our partnership and products. 

 If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Dale Lessard &lt;[[mailto:dale.lessard@honeywell.com]]&gt;, Honeywell Aerospace Global Supplier Development Engineer Leader. 

 Thank you in advance for your participation. 

 Best Regards, 

 Audrey Gorham
