    <subject>Honeywell’s CDS/R Exceeds More than 20 Million Flight Hours</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;     &lt;[[https://www.duncanaviation.aero/]]&gt;

With more than 20 million combined flight hours, Honeywell’s Primus Epic® control display system/retrofit (CDS/R) upgrade has helped several customers add new life to their cockpit while also improving safety and situational awareness. 

“We need the most flexible possible avionics system. Of course, the baseline avionics and aircraft is not designed to talk to strange systems, such as other flight management systems. Epic CDS/R gives us that flexibility. it has the interfaces we require, the computing power and the display capabilities we require.” – Dr. John Maris, President, Marinvent

To show Honeywell’s commitment to supporting CDS/R, Falcon 900A/B operators who upgrade are eligible for one free year of Honeywell Avionics Protection Plan (HAPP) after installation has been complete, and a $10,000 discount off years 2 and 3 of their 3-year or 5-year contract. As an added benefit, Honeywell is offering fixed year-over-year pricing on 5-year contracts.
