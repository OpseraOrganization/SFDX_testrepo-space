    <subject>Get ideas for {{lead.ABM Company Name:default=your company}} from George Strait</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {{lead.First Name:default=there}},

If you’re thinking about using this downtime to upgrade elements of your company&apos;s flight experience, we invite you to take a look at how we have improved the flight experience for country music superstar George Strait. 

When George Strait flies with bandmates, family and the rest of the entourage, staying as comfortable and connected in the air as they are on the ground is vitally important. He likes to use flight time to get work done or kick back and relax. He depends on reliable and fast connectivity to make that happen.

Learn more about why George relies on Honeywell systems in his aircraft to travel from his Texas home to concert sites, personal appearances and charity events across the country.
