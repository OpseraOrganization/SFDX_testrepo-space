Dear Customers,
Now is the time to upgrade to business aviation’s best inertial reference system – Honeywell’s LASEREF IV – the perfect replacement for your older LASEREF II or LASEREF III system. 

Honeywell and Duncan Aviation are offering special pricing plus a $52,500 Honeywell trade-in credit for operators who install the LASEREF IV by Dec. 31, 2019, which is also the date Honeywell plans to stop supporting LASEREF II and LASEREF III.

The LASEREF IV represents a significant advancement in inertial reference system technology. It offers a 30% improvement in reliability, 35% weight reduction, uses considerably less power and has the lowest cost of ownership of any IRS flying today!

Also considering upgrading to LCD displays? Consider bundling your DU-875 and LASEREF IV upgrades for additional savings.  For more information or to request a quote, contact Duncan Aviation today!
