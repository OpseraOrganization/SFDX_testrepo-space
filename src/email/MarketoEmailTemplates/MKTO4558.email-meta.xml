Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

At Honeywell, we understand trust is a huge factor when choosing your next IMU or navigator. Knowing you&apos;re getting a product true to its advertised specs is key and working with a team you can rely on for product support is critical &lt;[[https://youtu.be/uG_EXPMxWgg]]&gt;. 

Fortunately, our try before you buy program* allows you to test our products for up to 30 days. 

To get started, simply:



	- Provide us your contact and shipping information.
	- Tell us a little more about how you intend to test our products.
	- We’ll ship the unit to you at no cost.
	- Test the product and call us if you have any questions. 
	- When you’re ready to return it, simply use the same box and the return label we send you and let us know how it worked.



It’s that easy.
