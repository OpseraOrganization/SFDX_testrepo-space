    <textOnly>Upgrade Your Experience with GoDirect   
 
 
Honeywell is offering a software refresh program to extend the life of the out-of-production CNX-200 Cabin Network Router. This unique update replaces the existing software with the new GoDirect Routing Software, effectively extending the life span and providing more functionality, data and performance capabilities, all available from your tablet or smartphone.  

      CNX-200 with GoDirect Routing software is the key enabler to integrating end-to-end cabin network connectivity. GoDirect enables users to define what data is permitted to the aircraft, who is permitted to access the network and who pays for the data.     
     
With GoDirect and the low cost installation of CNX-200, you will stop contemplating your data usage every month, and start controlling it.
