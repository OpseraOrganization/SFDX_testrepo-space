    <textOnly>Thank you for your interest in our recent webinar: “Triple your awareness with Foreflight and AeroNav GPS” on June 25th.

Transitioning from flight planning to navigation has never been easier. In this webinar, we showed you tips and tricks to seamless integration of flight planning using Foreflight and your AeroNav navigators.

 You learned these simple steps to integrated flying: 



	- Pre-flight planning using ForeFlight
	- Wi-Fi flight plan upload to the AeroNav GPS navigator
	- Inflight screen sharing using the IFD100 App to double or even triple the number of AeroNav screens
	- Strategic flight re-planning en route and direct upload to AeroNav
