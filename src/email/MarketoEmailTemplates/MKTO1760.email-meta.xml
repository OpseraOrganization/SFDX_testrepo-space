Dear{{lead.Salutation:default=edit me}} {{lead.Last Name:default=Valued customer}},

Congratulations on the arrival of your new A350 aircraft. As you know, the A350 XWB represents a quantum leap in technology, from the carbon fiber composites and titanium alloys used in its structure, to its highly advanced turbofan engines and the HGT1700 auxiliary power unit, the most powerful APU ever built by Honeywell.
Such a ground-breaking design demands an equally innovative maintenance, repair &amp; overhaul (MRO) solution. Lufthansa Technik has been selected as Honeywell’s licensed component repair center and exclusive global asset service provider for the Airbus A350. As such, Honeywell components and auxiliary power units should be shipped directly to Lufthansa Technik for repair. Although we recognize that you have already made a decision on your A350 components provider, I wanted you to be aware of our partnership with Lufthansa Technik and most importantly the value they could offer your airline as your APU MRO provider.
Lufthansa Technik has already gained substantial experience with the new systems that make the A350 unique. Through cooperation with several A350 original equipment manufacturers, including Rolls Royce and Honeywell, operators will benefit from first-class and high-quality services, ranging from single component maintenance to more integrated flight-hour- or pooling-based product packages.
Maintenance services for Honeywell’s components on the Airbus A350 are now available to all airline customers via Lufthansa Technik. And with over 3,000 part numbers always in stock, Lufthansa Technik can provide immediate, global, “one phone call” access via their global logistics footprint. In our opinion, no other MRO partner is better prepared to keep your A350 fleet in the air.
Should you have any queries regarding the MRO solutions for your A350 fleet and the Honeywell agreement with Lufthansa Technik, we have prepared a frequently asked questions document which can be accessed via the link below. Alternatively, please do not hesitate to contact your Honeywell Customer Business Manager or Customer Support Manager.
