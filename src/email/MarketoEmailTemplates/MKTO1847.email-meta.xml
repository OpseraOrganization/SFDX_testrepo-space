Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},



During a recent courtesy call to inform you about Honeywell’s FMS 6.1 upgrade and the changes we’ve made to our FMS subscriptions, our sales representative noted that you’ve already upgraded to FMS 6.1 or are in the process of upgrading and have already scheduled your appointment.

Our records indicate that you have not yet completed the upgrade at this time and we want to make sure you’ve made plans to upgrade to FMS 6.1 before your next renewal.

Customers who do not upgrade to FMS v6.1 prior to December 31, 2017 will be charged an additional 20% surcharge to their annual navigational database subscription. Honeywell will no longer provide technical support for FMS versions prior to v.6.1 after December 31, 2018, but will continue to support navigational database updates. Customers are encouraged to upgrade their FMS subscription before their next renewal cycle.

Please let us know when you intend to upgrade or contact us today so that we can help you schedule your upgrade.
