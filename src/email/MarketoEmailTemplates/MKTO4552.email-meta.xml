    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

We fully recognize the challenges you come across when designing in a new inertial measurement or inertial navigation system into your design.

 Fortunately, our Honeywell application engineers have decades of experience and are here to help. If you need advice, documents, drawings or anything in between, our HG5700 team is ready to help you.

 Would you like to be connected to one of our application engineers? 

Yes &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/IMU-Thank-You.html?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20_rmus_jj&amp;utm_term=connect-with-engineer]]&gt; / No &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/IMU-Thank-You.html?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20_rmus_jj&amp;utm_term=no-engineers]]&gt;
