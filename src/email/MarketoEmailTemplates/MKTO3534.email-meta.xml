Dear Honeywell Customer:
The Aviation International News (AIN) Survey was released on May 1. Our goal is to achieve top marks in this survey and we need your feedback to make this happen. 
-- Gus
Honeywell takes AIN and other industry surveys seriously, therefore we have worked on several improvements.



	- Added more Field Service Engineers worldwide, like James Lee &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/news-listing/2018/april/honeywell-engineer-goes-the-distance-to-connect-with-customers]]&gt; (Satcom) and John Sanner &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/news-listing/2019/april/helicopter-technical-support-leader-is-a-breed-apart]]&gt; (Engines).
	- Enhanced our Direct Access App, empowering customers to get the support they need faster.
	- Increased Operator Conferences events to meet face to face with our customers globally. Register Here &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/events-listing/2019/january/2019-operator-conferences]]&gt; for an event near you.
	- Launched our Technical Knowledge Center with more than 8,000 knowledge articles that help customers resolve issues. Find Articles &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/services-and-support/support/technical-support]]&gt;
