    <textOnly>Hi {{lead.First Name:default=there}}, 

 We’ve tried to reach you a few times about our new, HG5700 IMU and we haven’t heard from you. 

 Whether you’d like to inquire with one of our applications engineers or talk to someone about pricing, we’re here for you. 

 Would you like someone to contact you? 

Yes  &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/IMU-Thank-You.html?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20_rmus_jj&amp;utm_term=contact-me]]&gt;/ No &lt;[[https://pages3.honeywell.com/IMU-Thank-You.html?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20_rmus_jj&amp;utm_term=dont-contact-me]]&gt;

 Thanks,

 The Honeywell HG5700 Team</textOnly>
