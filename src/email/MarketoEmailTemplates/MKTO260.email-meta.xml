    <textOnly>Dear Customer,

As a reminder next week Honeywell GDC will be introducing new enhancements to the myGDC.com website and iPad app. Enhancements include access to account management features and other online tools, plus increased online security.  

 What this means:


 - Current users with a GDC ID will be required to create a new Honeywell ID in order to log in to mygdc.com.
 - iPad users will need to download v 3.5 of the MyGDC app, now available on the Apple store.
 - Migration to a Honeywell ID has been rescheduled to begin June 8th and must be complete by June 30th, after which time users’ GDC IDs will no longer be active.



New MyGDC enhancements:


 - Single Sign On – Login once to the Honeywell Aerospace Portal or pilots.honeywell.com and switch to myGDC.com seamlessly
 - Self-management of credentials – users will be able to change their password, recover a forgotten password, change their user information and retrieve a forgotten username using our online tool
 - Improved online security



To learn more please go to MyGDC.com/NewID &lt;https://www.mygdc.com/new/static/migration.php&gt;, email us gfo@mygdc.com &lt;mailto:gfo@mygdc.com&gt; or phone at (888) 634-3330 or (425) 885-8100.</textOnly>
