Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

Recently, Honeywell surpassed a significant milestone of delivering more than 500,000 high performance inertial sensors and navigators to customers. 

With decades of experience testing and learning from our customers’ applications, we’ve been able to reach incredible heights in navigation technology. 

“We can recommend the Honeywell unit because we have used it for different projects in different countries, sometimes under difficult weather conditions and we have never had an issue with collecting or storing the data.&quot; - Aeroscout founder and general manager, Dr. Christoph Eck
