Dear Valued Channel Partner,


Is your customer’s aircraft ready for a major engine maintenance inspection? Are they contemplating grounding their aircraft?

With Honeywell’s TFE731 certified engine exchange program, you can exchange your customer’s run-of-the-mill engine for one of our certified, pre-owned TFE731 engines. Plus, they’ll receive a trade-in credit and free shipping for their old engine!

Don’t let their aircraft sit any longer. Purchase a TFE731 outright or exchange your customer’s TFE731 engine with us – it’s that simple.

And the best part? Honeywell channel partners can receive a discount on eligible TFE731 engines. 

Browse our certified, pre-owned inventory and choose the engine that’s right for your customer today.
