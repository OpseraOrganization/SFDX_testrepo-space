Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

For decades, Honeywell has paved the way for the inertial sensor and navigation market by providing reliable, dependable and high-performing solutions for a variety of industrial applications.

Our suite of non-ITAR, commercial HGuide IMUs and navigators &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/navigation-and-sensors/honeywell-hguide-inertial-sensors-and-navigators]]&gt; are designed and built with the same focus and quality that led to the creation of our industry-leading HG1700 IMU. 

Honeywell IMUs and navigators are built to meet a wide range of prices and performance standards and are individually tested to ensure every product meets or exceeds the specs we publish so that you’re able to accomplish the job you set out to do with confidence.

For a limited time, you can try a Honeywell IMU or navigator before you buy* to learn how our products can improve your design.
