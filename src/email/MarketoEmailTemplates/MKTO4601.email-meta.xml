    <textOnly>Travelling by business jet is all about time, convenience and productivity. In today’s competitive business world, you simply can’t afford to have things slow down—or stop altogether—while your C-suite passengers are travelling. 

 Connectivity pays. Especially when you consider the total compensation of senior executives earning salaries that equate to hundreds or even thousands of dollars per hour. So imagine the opportunity cost of an aircraft with sub-par Wi-Fi and multiple execs on board. 

 You don’t have to worry about that with Honeywell’s complete connectivity solution, which includes the industry’s best JetWave satellite communications system to provide fast reliable in-flight Wi-Fi, and our unique Honeywell Forge cabin connectivity and flight services platform that helps you connect, stay connected and get the job done.
