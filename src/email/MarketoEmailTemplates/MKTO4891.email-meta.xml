    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=customer}}, 

 While we missed engaging with you in person, we wanted to say thank you for attending our virtual booth last week at VBACE.

 Honeywell embraced the VBACE digital format and hosted a day one keynote session with aviation industry leaders. The topic on “The new era of safe and healthy travel” proved to be very insightful. If you missed this great discussion watch it here &lt;[[https://watch.honeywell.com/watch/W6fCQ4n5Lms1PZjD5YpxjR?]]&gt;.
