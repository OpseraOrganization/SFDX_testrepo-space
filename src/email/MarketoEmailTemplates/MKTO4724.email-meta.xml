    <textOnly>Hello!
 
My name is Jenni and I’m the product line director for Honeywell’s sensor portfolio. I am humbled and excited that you are considering our sensors for your next project. 

 To help us best serve you, please take a minute to tell us a little more about your inquiry: 



	- What is your role?
	- What is the application?
	- Is this a new application or a replacement in an existing application?
	- Is your question technical (product selection / data sheet) or transactional (quote / lead time)?


Thanks for your time.
