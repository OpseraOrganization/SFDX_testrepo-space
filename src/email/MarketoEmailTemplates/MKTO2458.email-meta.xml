MEET YOUR PRIMARY FSE IN THE FIELD
Hello, 
As your Honeywell customer support manager, I’m excited to introduce you to {{lead.FSE/Intiator name:default=Blank}}, who is your primary direct field service engineer.  You can still take advantage of the 24/7 global 
technical support network, but as the FSE in your area, {{lead.FSE/Intiator First Name:default=Blank}} will be your go-to contact when available.  We’re confident this will provide you with additional support where and when you need it.  
{{lead.FSE/Intiator First Name:default=Blank}} can be reached by phone at {{lead.FSE/Intiator Phone:default=Blank}}.  In addition, we’ll be reaching 
out to you over the next few weeks to introduce you to him.  
As always, if for some reason, he&apos;s unavailable, you can always take advantage of the responsive 24/7 technical support network by contacting us through www.MyAerospace.honeywell.com &lt;[[http://www.myaerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;, calling 1-855-808-6500 or e-mailing aerotechsupport@honeywell.com &lt;[[mailto:aerotechsupport@honeywell.com]]&gt;. 


If you have questions, please contact me.
