Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}},


Are you wondering how you can upgrade your business jet with global high-speed Wi-Fi? Do you want to have the same Wi-Fi experience at 35,000 feet as you do on the ground? Honeywell’s JetWave™ system which exclusively powers Inmarsat’s Jet ConneX Ka-band service, is now certified on more than 16 aircraft models with more coming onboard! Check out the full list here &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/~/media/aerospace/files/infographics/jetwavecertificationlistfebruary2018.pdf]]&gt;. 



There’s a reason why all the major business jet manufacturers have selected JetWave™ – we enable Wi-Fi that flies.


Don’t miss out on your chance to be an early adopter, and not a laggard!
