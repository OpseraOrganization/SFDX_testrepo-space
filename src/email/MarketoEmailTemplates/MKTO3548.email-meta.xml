Admit It—You and Every Passenger Crave High-Speed Wi-Fi

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Customer}}, 

Passenger surveys all say the same thing – your customers want the fastest, most consistent Wi-Fi connection possible. A Honeywell survey &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/~/media/wifithatflies/files/2016-connectivity-survey-infographic-en.pdf]]&gt; even showed that passengers would abandon their preferred airline for it. A fast and secure Wi-Fi connection also opens the door to better operations and more planes in the air with better on-time arrivals. And it’s now possible to stream movies and music and to download those large work files and photos. To find out more, visit wifithatflies.com &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/wifithatflies]]&gt;.

Please contact us for more information.
