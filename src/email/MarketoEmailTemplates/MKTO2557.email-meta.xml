 Flightstar Extends Learjet 40 and 45 Life with DU-875 Upgrade

Learjet 40 and 45 operators depend on clear views and reliability to get them from point a to point b in the most efficient way possible. The DU-875 upgrade with Honeywell Authorized Service Center Flightstar provides operators one of the clearest views and provides an upgrade path to Primus Elite, plus it offers:  
 
 • Uplinked Graphical Weather 
 • Geo-political Boundaries 
 • 
Navigation aids (NAVAIDS)
• And much more…

Check out what others are saying: “The 
improved avionics of the DU-875 assist us with our medevac flights because they’re often at very short notice…The better display clarity and the data available on those displays really makes it a lot easier for the flight crew to become familiar with the airport that they’re operating into”  – Lorne Cole, managing director, JetCity. 
 
 For a limited time, Honeywell is offering a trade-in credit for Learjet 40 and 45 operators. So, you can save up to $160,000* when you trade-in all four displays. Plus, when you choose Flightstar’s ADS-B Out STC, Flightstar will waive the STC cost. Contact Flightstar today to take advantage of these special offers as they expire soon.
