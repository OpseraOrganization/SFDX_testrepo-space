    <subject>2018 Catalog Pricing Now Available on MyAerospace Portal</subject>
    <textOnly>&lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt;

Dear Customer, 



We&apos;d like to remind you that our updated 2018 catalog pricing is available on Honeywell’s MyAerospace &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/parts-and-repairs/downloads/pricing-catalogs]]&gt; Portal. This includes spares pricing as well as universal flat fate (UFR) repairs pricing.


Important Information: 


	- 
Since Honeywell’s pricing policy applies to when an order is delivered, all orders placed with lead times indicating delivery in 2018 must reflect the 2018 price. If an existing order needs updated, a Honeywell representative will contact you.

	- 
You must update your internal tracking systems to reflect the 2018 catalog pricing unless you have contractual pricing with Honeywell.

	- 
Failure to update your system may result in 2018 order delivery delays since an updated purchase order will be required.

	- 
You may access the new pricing when searching for parts using MyAerospace’s Online Ordering or downloading the pricing catalog from MyAerospace &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/parts-and-repairs/downloads/pricing-catalogs]]&gt;.



Thank you for your cooperation in updating your tracking systems to reflect 2018 pricing. If you have any questions, please contact your Honeywell Customer Support contact or submit a question &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us]]&gt; through MyAerospace. 
The MyAerospace Portal &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/]]&gt; is always available for your order management needs, including parts quoting, ordering, and tracking. View MyAerospace updates and tutorials here &lt;[[https://myaerospace.honeywell.com/contact-us/myaerospace-training]]&gt;.
