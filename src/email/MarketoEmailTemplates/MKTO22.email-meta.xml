    <textOnly>Dear {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}} {{lead.Last Name:default=edit me}},

 

Honeywell is working to improve our estimated ship date and notifications process for repair and overhaul customers. We would like to include your opinions to help guide those efforts. 

We’ve hired an independent market research firm, Lynx Research, to conduct an online survey. 

We encourage you to respond quickly, as this survey will be available only until a predetermined number of responses have been received. 

To complete the survey, simply click on the link below, or copy the entire web address into the address bar of your web browser.  Please make sure you copy the whole link.

Please be assured that no one will attempt to sell you anything as a result of participating in this survey.  The findings will be used for research purposes only, and the identities of the participants will be kept completely confidential. If you have any questions, please email Lori Goodman at LGoodman@lynxresearch.net &lt;mailto:LGoodman@lynxresearch.net&gt;

Thank you in advance for completing our survey. 

Sincerely,

The Honeywell Customer Experience Team</textOnly>
