Hi {{lead.First Name:default=edit me}},

At Honeywell, we strive to produce high-performance, non-ITAR, inertial measurement units and inertial navigation systems. 

We take performance standards seriously, so we personally test each of our products in real world situations to give you the confidence you need to buy from us. 

Recently, we put our quality standards to the test to demonstrate how rugged our HG4930 IMU &lt;[[https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/navigation-and-sensors/hg4930]]&gt; is by letting college hockey players hit on the ice at speeds up to 80 mph. 

You can watch the video here to see it for yourself &lt;[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGWuTsv5rBs]]&gt;.  

For a limited time, you can try a Honeywell IMU or navigator before you buy* to learn how our products can improve your design.
