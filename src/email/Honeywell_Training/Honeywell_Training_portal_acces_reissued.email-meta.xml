    <textOnly>Dear Customer,


Your account information entered does not provide sufficient data to enable access to the training portal and class registration.

· Your information must be associated with an active company account, in the Honeywell system

· Your company’s account must be established with Honeywell, before employees can setup and link their accounts

· The company account identifies and establishes the products and services we provide to your organization

· Please ensure all your account data is complete, as this is associated to products and services you are eligible to receive, incomplete data delays access to class registration

· Note - the primary email address entered on your account, must be a company email address

· Email addresses such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc., are not identified company addresses and delay your request for access
