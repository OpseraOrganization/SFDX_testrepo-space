    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.OwnerFullName},



It has been 2 weeks since this lead was assigned to you.



Please review the lead and take the required action at your earliest convenience to Convert, Disqualify, or Recycle it. If you do not update this lead within 48 hours, we will report it as part of the Leaked Leads Report that is circulated to Sales Leaders and the Aerospace Leadership Team.



Access your lead from the summary information below:



Lead: {!Lead.Link}



Company: {!Lead.Company}



Name: {!Lead.Name}



Product Information: {!Lead.ATR_Product_Information__c}



We are excited to let you know that our marketing efforts have led to a sales lead that we’ve initially researched and felt should be assigned to you as lead owner in SFDC to contact the customer and pursue the deal.



Please evaluate the lead immediately and, if it looks accurate, move the lead status to Sales Accepted Lead (SAL). If it is not, please change the lead status to Recycle or Disqualified. Should your SAL become a Sales Qualified Lead (SQL) after a conversation with this customer, please change the lead status and convert it to an Opportunity.



Please also update the “Honeywell Response Date” &amp; “Next Steps” field accordingly. The most recent communication from the customer can be found in the “Next Steps” section.



We are giving away random BRAVOs for those who act on these leads within 48 hours, and unfortunately reporting those who do not update this lead within two weeks (referred to as a “leaked lead”).  We look forward to hearing whether this is a legitimate revenue opportunity for Honeywell Aerospace, and winning it!



Thank you so much for contributing to Honeywell’s growth!
