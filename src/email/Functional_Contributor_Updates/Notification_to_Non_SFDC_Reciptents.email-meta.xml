“Cost or Pricing Data” (FAR 15.406-2 in accordance with definitions contained in 2.101) means all facts as of the date of price agreement, or, if applicable, an earlier date agreed upon between the parties that is as close as practicable to the date of agreement on price, that prudent buyers and sellers would reasonably expect to affect price negotiations significantly.  Cost or pricing data are factual, not judgmental; and are verifiable.  While they do not indicate the accuracy of the prospective contractor’s judgment about future costs or projections, they do include the data forming the basis for that judgment.  Cost or pricing data are more than historical accounting data; they are all the facts that can be reasonably expected to contribute to the soundness of estimates of future costs and to the validity of determinations of costs already incurred.  Cost or Pricing data include: Vendor Quotations, Nonrecurring Costs, Information on changes in production methods and in production or purchasing volume,  Data supporting projections of business prospects and objectives and related operations costs, Unit cost trends such as those associated with Labor efficiency, Make-or-Buy decisions, Estimated resources to obtain business goals, Information on management decisions that could have a significant bearing on cost, Rate Changes or Policy Changes.</textOnly>
