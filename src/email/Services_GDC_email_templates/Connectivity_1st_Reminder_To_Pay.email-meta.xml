    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

A review of your account shows that some invoice/s appear unpaid. We understand that oversights happen so we are sending a friendly reminder to determine when we can expect payment.



If you have not received the invoice(s) we apologize. Please forward the attached documents to your accounts payable team to begin the payment process. We would appreciate your reply with the payment details so we can be sure that it is posted correctly to your account.



If you have any questions or need more information please do not hesitate to contact me.



Thanks in advance for your cooperation. We appreciate your continued business.
