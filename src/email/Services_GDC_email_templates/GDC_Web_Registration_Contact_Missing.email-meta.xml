    <textOnly>Dear {           },

We have received a request from {!Case.Contact} for access to view FalconConnect account data for {!Contact.Account_Name__c}



Because we do not show {!Contact.FirstName} as a contact on your account, we would like your approval to grant access.



Would you please reply to this email and let me know if we have your authorization to allow access to this contact?



If you have an questions, or need more information please do not hesitate to contact me.



Thank you,
