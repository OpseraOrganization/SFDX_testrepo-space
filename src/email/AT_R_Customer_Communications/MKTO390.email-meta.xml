Dear Honeywell Customer,
Last month we shared with you our SAP transition plans for the Singapore Loyang Avionic R&amp;O site. And we promised to provide you updates along the way. We are excited to say that we are still progressing towards a Sept. 27th, 2015, transition date.
You may recall, the Singapore SAP transition will result in a change to the Honeywell legal entity. Although the Singapore Loyang Avionic repairs will be performed at the same site, you will need to update the supplier information in your internal systems. 
 
 To minimize order disruptions, here are the steps you’ll want and need to take as a result of this change: 




 - Update your internal purchasing, authorized supplier list and quality management system (QMS) to reflect this legal entity name change. A transition checklist &lt;https://pages3.honeywell.com/rs/641-QIX-912/images/Singapore 60 Day Transition Preparation Checklist .pdf&gt; is available and includes the new supplier address, amended “Ship To” address, and invoicing and payment bank details. 
 




 - For Contract Customers only: Execute an Amendment Agreement to assign Contracts, to include HIS and/or delete HASPL/ HAPL from Contract, to amend Bank details, delivery /export clauses, notices address etc., where required. Our Customer Business Managers and Contracts team have been in contact with your company to provide additional information to complete this action this month. 


If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to your Honeywell Customer Business Manager or email us at AeroCPSCommunications@Honeywell.com &lt;mailto:AeroCPSCommunications@Honeywell.com&gt;.
