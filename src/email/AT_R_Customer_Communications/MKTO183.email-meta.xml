Dear Honeywell Customer, 

Simple. Quick. Accurate.

That’s how every interaction with Honeywell should be. To help make sure that happens, we’re in the process of consolidating customer account numbers.  Starting today, we will consolidate your Sold To accounts into one selection on the portal.

These changes will be handled internally, and should have no effect on your operations.  As soon as we make the change, you will receive an email confirmation that your profile has been updated. There will be fewer customer codes to choose from when you enter the web portal. But everything you need to complete your order, including each of the Ship-To and Bill-to options will be there, in a more user-friendly format.  

We’ve been diligent in making sure the account code changes are launched seamlessly. But if you do experience any disruptions to your operations, or have questions about the process, please contact your Customer Business Manager. 

Best regards,

Rich DeGraff
